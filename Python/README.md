# Wikia's Python Guidelines

This directory contains guidelines for creating and/or contributing to Python projects at Wikia.

There are currently three main documents:

* [Coding Conventions](CodingConventions.md)
* [Project Organization, Packaging, and Deployment](ProjectOrganization.md)
* [Scenario Guide](ScenarioGuide.md)

If you're new to Python, you should check out the [Python 101] course that was taught at Wikia
in July/August 2014. Another good place to start is [The Hitchhiker’s Guide to Python]. It's a great
guide maintained by dozens of the most respected Pythonistas in the community.
