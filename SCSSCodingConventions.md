# Wikia SCSS Coding Conventions

This styleguide defines the SCSS coding conventions at Wikia. While it is managed by the Front End Coding Conventions Team, it is here to serve the entire developer community at Wikia. Therefore, if you would like to propose a change, simply create a pull request and tag @wikia-frontenders.

## Our Mission

As a developer I want a clear and well documented guide dealing with coding conventions, patterns and best practices for coding SCSS style sheets at Wikia along with tools to help me in making my code compliant.
